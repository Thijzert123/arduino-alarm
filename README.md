# Arduino Alarm
This is a security alarm for Arduino. It needs an LCD display, IR receiver, RGB LED, sound module, ultrasonic sensor.

It works by setting a 'safe' value of the ultrasonic sensor. When that changes by an configurable amount, the alarm goes off. You can control all of these things with an IR device.
